# Simlex999-Dutch

Word embeddings revolutionised natural language processing by effectively representing words as dense vectors. Although many datasets exist to evaluate English embeddings, few cater to Dutch. 
This study developed a Dutch variant of the SimLex-999 dataset, confirmed for its reliability and validity through an analysis involving 235 native Dutch speakers. 
Its findings showed substantial semantic overlap with English and German SimLex-999 datasets. The new dataset was used to evaluate two Dutch language models, Bertje and RobBERT. 
Despite certain variations, Bertje showed superior alignment with human semantic similarity judgments. 
This research contributed a reliable Dutch word embedding evaluation dataset, enabling accurate assessment of these embeddings and fostering the development of effective Dutch language processing models. 
It also highlighted the challenges of dealing with out-of-vocabulary words, providing critical insights for future work in Dutch natural language processing.
