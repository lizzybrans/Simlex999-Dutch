# Simlex999-Dutch

Word embeddings revolutionised natural language processing by effectively representing words as dense vectors. Although many datasets exist to evaluate English embeddings, few cater to Dutch. This study developed a Dutch variant of the SimLex-999 word pairs list and transformed it into a dataset by gathering similarity judgements from 235 native Dutch speakers. The reliability and validity of the new dataset were confirmed through an agreement calculation analysis based on these judgements. The new dataset was used to evaluate two Dutch language models, Bertje and RobBERT. Despite certain variations, Bertje showed superior alignment with human semantic similarity judgments compared to RobBERT. This study provides a reliable Dutch word embedding evaluation dataset. This enables accurate assessment of these embeddings and fosters the development of effective Dutch language processing models.
